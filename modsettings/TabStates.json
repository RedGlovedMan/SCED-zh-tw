Insert your deck ID and it will build the deck automatically for you.\n\nSCENARIOS \u0026 SETUP\n- Arkham Horror LCG comes with a core campaign (Night of the Zealot) and several expansions. Within each box you will find all the cards required for each scenario setup, as well as a the official campaign guide PDF.\n\n2. Each scenario is setup differently, and while some of the work has been prepared beforehand (such as building encounter decks), you will have to refer to the Campaign Guide for specific instructions on how to set up each scenario.\n\nINVESTIGATOR PLAYMAT AND GAMEPLAY\n- Playermats are scripted to automate most of the gameplay for you.",
